This tutorial shows how to detect new seismic events with template matching starting from a known earthquake (using FMF, of course!). The tutorial is organized into a series of four python jupyter notebooks.

# Prerequisite

First, create a new folder called *FMF_tuto* and download the material required by this tutorial at:<br/>
[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3vvwn072o0kde05/AAATww2-BkKRRGf9SyjBjNC8a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3vvwn072o0kde05/AAATww2-BkKRRGf9SyjBjNC8a?dl=0)<br/>
Extract the content of the archive in *FMF_tuto*.


- To avoid issues caused by package discrepancies, we provide a conda environment ready for cloning. If you do not have the anaconda distribution, please have a look at [https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). To clone our environment, open a terminal in *FMF_tuto* and run:
```bash
conda create --name FMF_tuto --file FMF_tuto_Python_packages.txt
```
- Activate your new conda environment with:
```bash
source activate FMF_tuto
```
- You now need to install FMF. Move to the folder *fast_matched_filter* and run:
```bash
python setup.py build
pip install .
```
We also refer you to the [installation](https://ebeauce.github.io/FMF_documentation/#installation) tab of this documentation.

# Running the Tutorial

Open a terminal in *FMF_tuto* and run:
```bash
source activate FMF_tuto
jupyter notebook
```
You now are connected to a jupyter environment, and thus can have an interactive access with the jupyter notebooks. Go through the four notebooks in this order:<br/>
- 1) build_template_from_catalog.ipynb<br/>
- 2) matched_filter_search.ipynb<br/>
- 3) extract_new_detections.ipynb<br/>
- 4) plot_detections.ipynb<br/>
