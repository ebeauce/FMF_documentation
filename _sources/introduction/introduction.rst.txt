Description
-----------
An efficient seismic matched-filter search for both CPU and GPU architectures.

If you use FMF in research to be published, please reference the following article: Beauc√©, Eric, W. B. Frank, and Alexey Romanenko (2017). Fast matched-filter (FMF): an efficient seismic matched-filter search for both CPU and GPU architectures.Seismological Research Letters, doi: `10.1785/0220170181 <https://doi.org/10.1785/0220170181>`_

FMF is available at `https://github.com/beridel/fast_matched_filter <https://github.com/beridel/fast_matched_filter>`_ and can be downloaded with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/beridel/fast_matched_filter.git

Required software/hardware:
---------------------------
* A C compiler that supports OpenMP (default Mac OS compiler clang does not support OpenMP; gcc can be easily downloaded via homebrew), 
* CPU version: either Python (v2.7 or 3.x) or Matlab, 
* GPU version: Python (v2.7 or 3.x) and a discrete Nvidia graphics card that supports CUDA C with CUDA toolkit installed. 

FMF is known to run well with gcc 6.8.X, and cuda 10.0.
