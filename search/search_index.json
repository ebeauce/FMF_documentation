If you use FMF in research to be published, please reference the following article: Beauc\u00e9, Eric, W. B. Frank, and Alexey Romanenko (2017). Fast matched-filter (FMF): an efficient seismic matched-filter search for both CPU and GPU architectures. Seismological Research Letters , doi: 10.1785/0220170181 FMF is available @ https://github.com/beridel/fast_matched_filter and can be downloaded with: $ git clone https://github.com/beridel/fast_matched_filter.git Required software/hardware: - A C compiler that supports OpenMP (default Mac OS compiler clang does not support OpenMP; gcc can be easily downloaded via homebrew), - CPU version: either Python (v2.7 or 3.x) or Matlab, - GPU version: Python (v2.7 or 3.x) and a discrete Nvidia graphics card that supports CUDA C with CUDA toolkit installed. FMF is known to run well with gcc 4.8.4 or 4.8.5, and cuda 7.5. Installation A simple make + whichever implementation does the trick. Possible make commands are: $ make python_cpu $ make python_gpu $ make matlab NB: Matlab compiles via mex, which needs to be setup before running. Any compiler can be chosen during the setup of mex, because it will be bypassed by the CC environment variable in the Makefile. Therefore CC must be set to an OpenMP-compatible compiler. Also, make sure the mex_extension variable in the Makefile corresponds to your OS (the different variables for each OS are listed in the Makefile). Installation as a Python module is possible via setup tools or even pip (which supports clean uninstalling): $ python setup.py build $ python setup.py install OR $ python setup.py build $ pip install Running Matlab : Matlab only supports the CPU version, which is called with the fast_matched_filter function (provided in the fast_matched_filter.m file). Python : Both CPU and GPU versions are called with the matched_filter function.

Because Matlab and Python use different conventions for the mapping between the indexing and the location in memory, the input arrays have different dimensions depending on whether Matlab or Python is used. Matlab: In Matlab, the most contiguous dimension is the first one. Therefore, the arrays should have dimensions: - continuous data (n_samples_data, n_components, n_stations) - template waveforms (n_samples_template, n_components, n_stations, n_detections) - moveouts (n_components, n_stations) Python: In Python, the most contiguous dimension is the last one. Therefore, the arrays should have dimensions: - continuous data (n_stations, n_components, n_samples_data) - template waveforms (n_detections, n_stations, n_components, n_samples_template) - moveouts (n_stations, n_components) Output of FMF FMF returns the time series of the average correlation coefficients (CC) calculated for each template given in input. Therefore, the output has dimensions: - Python: (n_templates, n_correlations), - Matlab: (n_correlations, n_templates). The number of correlations (n_correlations) is determined by the length of the continuous data and the temporal step you used. To perform earthquake detection from the CC time series, we typically look for the samples that exceed a threshold defined by 8xRMS or 10xMAD ( cf. figure below). Figure from: Beauc\u00e9, Eric, W. B. Frank, and Alexey Romanenko (2017). Fast matched-filter (FMF): an efficient seismic matched-filter search for both CPU and GPU architectures.
